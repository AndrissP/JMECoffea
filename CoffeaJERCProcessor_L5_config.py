    ### Choose the jet flavour. Some samples have missing `partonFlavour`, so one has to redo the flavour matching oneself. Two different option were implemented:
    ### `LHE_flavour` starts from the jet and matches to the closest LHE particle.
    ### `LHE_flavour2` (a better option) starts from the LHE particle and matches to the jet. Was slower than LHE_flavor before a numba compiled implementation for ak.count was made.
